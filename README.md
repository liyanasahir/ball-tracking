# COLORED BALL TRACKING USING OPENCV
Python-OpenCV code for tracking multiple colored balls

Base code derived from  <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/" >this </a>tutorial.

## Working
The file trackballs.py tracks two colored balls(red and green) in the given HSV range and displays the traces on screen. 
Reads frames from webcam as well as video source, a sample video for testing will be updated soon. 

#### Limitations to work on:
 Tracks only the two colors within the defined range.
